# Singly Linked List
Implement a singly linked list which exposes an includes as well as a insert method for the user to interact with.


## Challenge
- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list


## Approach & Efficiency
Insertions with O(1) by moving pointers only at the head of the LL
includes at O(n) by iterating once through data

## API
LinkedList()
LinkedList.insert(val: int)
LinkedList.includes(val:int)
Node(val:int)
